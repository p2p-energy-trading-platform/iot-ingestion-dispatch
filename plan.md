# IoT Ingestion & Dispatch Service - Plan

* **Author:** Hanan (M.S.H. Ahmed)
* **Scope:** IoT Ingestion Service (primary focus) + Dispatch Service (documented, not implemented yet) + gRPC query interface (documented, not implemented yet)
* **Stack:** Go
* **Status:** Draft v4 - revised per team member review and final pre-development pass (fixed a stale diagram contradiction, an unwired schema field, a missing proto field, and made several assumptions explicit - see inline "Correction:" notes)

---

## 1. What this service does

The IoT Ingestion Service is the receiving end of the telemetry pipeline. The IoT Simulator publishes readings over MQTT; a separate MQTT-to-Kafka bridge (built by a teammate) pushes those messages into Kafka. This service's job starts from there: **consume every message from Kafka, and persist it into the right storage tier so the rest of the platform can actually use it.**

Two storage tiers are in scope right now:

- **Redis (hot storage)** - the latest known state of every house/meter, for fast reads by anything that needs "what's happening right now" (e.g. a live dashboard).
- **TimescaleDB (warm storage)** - the full historical record, structured for time-range queries and analytics (e.g. "show me house0042's net_kw over the last 24 hours").

**Cold storage** (long-term archival, e.g. object storage) is explicitly **out of scope for now**. The warm storage design should not make cold storage harder to add later, but nothing needs to be built for it yet.

This service also owns two components that are **documented in this plan but not implemented yet**:

- **Dispatch Service** - the piece that eventually turns a trading decision into a real actuation command sent back down to the IoT Simulator over MQTT.
- **gRPC query interface** - an internal API other services can use to query hot/warm data without needing their own Kafka consumer or direct DB access.

                                                                              |                           |

                                                                        (hot storage)              (warm storage)
                                                                              |                           |
                                                                              +-------------+-------------+
                                                                                            |
                                                                                    gRPC query API
                                                                              (future - other platform services read here)


Order Service --(gRPC call, based on user preferences - see section 7)--> Dispatch Service --MQTT actuation topic--> IoT Simulator
```

**Correction:** this diagram previously showed the Matching Engine triggering Dispatch directly. Section 7 (based on the team member's actual clarification) states the opposite - the Matching Engine has no visibility into individual assets and does *not* trigger Dispatch; an Order Service does, via gRPC. The diagram had gone stale relative to that later, more detailed section. Fixed here so the two don't contradict each other.

**Confirmed from `gridx-infra`:** the MQTT-to-Kafka bridge is not custom code - it's a `kafka-connect` container running the Confluent `MqttSourceConnector` (a standard, off-the-shelf Kafka Connect plugin).

> ✅ **Topic mismatch resolved.** The connector has been split into two files, `mqtt-connector-meter.json` (`mqtt.topics: gridx/+/+/meter` → `kafka.topic: iot.meter-readings`) and `mqtt-connector-heartbeat.json` (`mqtt.topics: gridx/+/+/heartbeat` → `kafka.topic: iot.heartbeats`). Both patterns correctly match what the IoT Simulator actually publishes, confirmed directly against the simulator's `topics.ts` and `tickLoop.ts`.

**One important design rule carried over from the IoT Simulator's own plan:** the simulator only ever talks to the outside world through MQTT. It never talks to Kafka, Redis, TimescaleDB, or this service directly. This service is downstream of the simulator - it observes and stores, it doesn't reach back except through the Dispatch Service's actuation path, which itself only ever talks back to the simulator over MQTT (the exact same `gridx/actuation` topic the simulator already listens on).

---

## 3. Kafka consumption

- This service runs as a **single Kafka consumer group**, subscribed to both `iot.meter-readings` and `iot.heartbeats`, dispatching each record to the correct handler based on which topic it arrived on.
- **Why one group, not two:** ordering isn't a factor either way - Kafka only orders within a partition, and the two message types already live on physically separate topics regardless of grouping, so there's no ordering guarantee to gain by splitting further. The real reason to split would be independent *scaling* of the much-higher-volume meter-reading stream away from heartbeat processing - at this project's scale, a single Go process handles both comfortably, and goroutines make "two topics, one process" close to free. Simpler to run and deploy while already juggling Kafka, Redis, TimescaleDB, and goose in one service.
- **One real risk worth designing around regardless of grouping:** a Go process dies on an unrecovered panic. A bug in heartbeat processing shouldn't be able to take down meter-reading processing just because they share a process. Handlers return ordinary errors (feeding into the failure-recording path in section 3.3) rather than panicking - this sidesteps the risk entirely as long as that discipline is maintained.
- **Partitioning / ordering:** a partitioning key is needed so all of one house's messages land in the same partition and process in order. **Likely already satisfied without further work:** Confluent's MQTT Source Connector documentation (checked directly) describes using the source MQTT topic string as the Kafka message key by default. Since each house publishes to its own unique topic (`gridx/{grid_id}/{house_id}/meter`), that string becoming the key would naturally group every message from the same house onto the same partition via Kafka's default hash-based partitioner. Treat this as *likely* true, not *confirmed* true, until verified against real traffic once the pipeline is live (section 13).

### 3.1 Message format - protobuf via `go-sdk` (status: reopened - conflicting signals, needs one empirical check before implementation)

Per team member direction: message types coming through Kafka need **protobuf contracts** (`.proto` schema definitions), compiled to Go types via CI/CD into the org's **`go-sdk`** repository, installed as a Go module dependency rather than hand-writing types.

**Confirmed, not in dispute:** `go-sdk`'s `gen/gridx/` tree currently has `grid/v1`, `order/v1`, `test/v1` - **no `iot` package yet**. New `.proto` files need authoring in the separate `protobuf` repo, following the exact convention established by the existing packages. See section 3.2 for a drafted proposal. This part of the task is unaffected by the wire-format question below.

**What's actually in dispute:** whether Kafka messages arrive as binary protobuf or as JSON text, and it's worth being precise about why this isn't fully settled yet:

- **Team member's position:** the protobuf layer isn't connected to the simulator; Kafka data comes as binary; the IoT Simulator is "outside the system."
- **Direct evidence pointing the other way:** both connector configs use `value.converter: ByteArrayConverter`, which forwards whatever bytes MQTT provides completely unchanged. The simulator's own `tickLoop.ts` confirms every publish goes through `JSON.stringify(reading)` before sending. Nothing inspected so far in the actual pipeline performs a JSON→protobuf conversion.
- **These aren't actually contradictory claims about architecture vs. implementation** - "the simulator is outside the system" is true and reasonable as a design principle, but it doesn't by itself change what bytes are physically sitting in the Kafka topic today. If something *does* perform that conversion upstream (a mechanism not yet reviewed here), team member's statement is simply correct and this section's earlier conclusion was based on an incomplete picture. If nothing does, the bytes in the topic are still JSON.

**Resolves in one command, not further debate.** From the host machine (not inside a container):
```bash
kcat -b localhost:9092 -t iot.meter-readings -C -c 1
```
(per `docker-compose.yml`'s `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: 'INTERNAL://kafka:29092,EXTERNAL://localhost:9092'` - `localhost:9092` is the correct external address, not `gridx-kafka:9092`, which won't resolve outside the Docker network). Install with `sudo apt install kafkacat` if not already present. Readable text starting with `{"schema_version"...` confirms JSON; unreadable/garbled bytes confirms binary.

**The engineering answer that makes this not architecturally costly either way:** isolate the decode step behind one function, so nothing downstream needs to know or care which answer comes back:
```go
// internal/kafka/decode.go
func DecodeMeterReading(raw []byte) (*models.MeterReading, error) {
    // if JSON: json.Unmarshal into a wire struct, then map fields to models.MeterReading
    // if binary: proto.Unmarshal(raw, &iotv1.MeterReading{}), then map to models.MeterReading
    // Either way, this is the ONLY function that changes based on the answer above.
}
```
The Redis writer, TimescaleDB writer, and heartbeat processor never see raw bytes - only the internal `models.MeterReading` type. This isolation is worth having regardless of how the wire-format question resolves.

### 3.2 Proposed `iot/v1` proto contract (draft, matching established conventions)

Based directly on the style of the existing `grid_transfer_rule.proto` and `order_events.proto` (proto3, `gridx.<domain>.v1` package naming, `_UNSPECIFIED = 0` as the first enum value, the `go_package` alias pattern), and the exact field shapes the IoT Simulator already publishes (`MeterReadingPayload` / `HeartbeatPayload`):

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package gridx.iot.v1;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

option go_package = "github.com/p2p-energy-trading-platform/go-sdk/gen/gridx/iot/v1;iotv1";

enum DeviceClass {
  DEVICE_CLASS_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  DEVICE_CLASS_CONSUMER = 1;
  DEVICE_CLASS_RESIDENTIAL_PROSUMER = 2;
  DEVICE_CLASS_COMMERCIAL = 3;
}

enum AssetType {
  ASSET_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  ASSET_TYPE_BESS = 1;
  ASSET_TYPE_EV = 2;
}

message StorageAssetReading {
  string asset_id = 1;
  AssetType asset_type = 2;
  double soc_pct = 3;
  double power_kw = 4;
  double capacity_kwh = 5;
  bool plugged_in = 6;
}

message MeterReading {
  string schema_version = 1;
  string meter_id = 2;
  string house_id = 3;
  string grid_id = 4;
  DeviceClass device_class = 5;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 6;
  uint64 seq = 7;
  double solar_kw = 8;
  double consumption_kw = 9;
  double net_kw = 10;
  repeated StorageAssetReading storage_assets = 11;
  double weather_irradiance_wm2 = 12;
  double cloud_cover_pct = 13;
}

message FlexibleAssetCapability {
  string asset_id = 1;
  AssetType asset_type = 2;
  double capacity_kwh = 3;
  double max_charge_kw = 4;
  double max_discharge_kw = 5;
  bool v2g_capable = 6;
}

message Heartbeat {
  string schema_version = 1;
  string grid_id = 2;
  string house_id = 3;
  string meter_id = 4;
  string status = 5;
  DeviceClass device_class = 6;
  double rated_solar_kw = 7;
  repeated FlexibleAssetCapability flexible_assets = 8;
}
```

**Correction:** `status` was missing from this draft entirely - the real simulator payload includes it (currently always `"online"`, per the simulator's own plan, but it's a real published field and the stated goal here is to define the canonical shape of what's *actually* published, not a trimmed-down version of it). Added as field 5, which shifted the numbering of every field after it - worth double-checking nothing downstream assumed the old numbers if any code was already written against this draft.

**Design notes - presenting this as a real decision, not a silent pick:**

- **`readings`/`meta` nesting.** Two real options, not one default with an asterisk:
  - **Flat** (as drafted above) - matches `OrderAccepted`'s style in the existing codebase, fewer types to generate and pass around, simpler Go struct mapping.
  - **Nested** (`message MeterReadingData { solar_kw, consumption_kw, ... }` + `message WeatherMeta { weather_irradiance_wm2, cloud_cover_pct }`, referenced as fields inside `MeterReading`) - mirrors the simulator's actual JSON shape (`readings.solar_kw`, `meta.weather_irradiance_wm2`) more literally, which could matter if the wire format does turn out to be JSON (section 3.1) and a more literal 1:1 field mapping simplifies the decode step.

  This plan defaults to flat because it matches established convention in this codebase, but it's a genuine open choice, not a settled one - confirm with the team before submitting to the `protobuf` repo.
- No `ActuationCommand` message drafted yet - deferred until the Dispatch Service (section 7) is actually scoped.
- This would live at `proto/gridx/iot/v1/iot_events.proto` in the `protobuf` repo, following the existing `order_events.proto` naming pattern.
- This draft is valid regardless of how section 3.1's wire-format question resolves - it defines the canonical message shape either way.

### 3.3 Failure handling - dead-letter strategy

**Two failure tiers, handled differently:**
- **Transient** (a Redis timeout, a brief DB connection blip) - usually self-resolves within seconds. Retry with bounded exponential backoff.
- **Permanent** (malformed payload, a `device_class` value that doesn't map to anything known) - retrying produces the identical error every time. Fail immediately rather than burning through retry attempts.

`github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v5` fits this directly via its `backoff.Permanent(err)` wrapper, which stops retrying immediately instead of exhausting attempts on an error that will never succeed:

```go
attempts := 0
_, err := backoff.Retry(ctx, func() (struct{}, error) {
    attempts++
    if writeErr := warmStore.WriteMeterReading(ctx, reading); writeErr != nil {
        if isPermanent(writeErr) {
            return struct{}{}, backoff.Permanent(writeErr)
        }
        return struct{}{}, writeErr // transient - Retry backs off and tries again
    }
    return struct{}{}, nil
}, backoff.WithMaxTries(3))

if err != nil {
    recordFailure(ctx, rawMsg, "timescale_write", err, attempts) // writes to the table below, then commit offset
}
```

**Correction:** the schema originally included an `attempt_count` column that the retry code never actually populated - it would have silently stayed at its default of 1 even after a transient failure genuinely retried 3 times, which is misleading for anyone debugging later from the table. Fixed by threading the real attempt count through to `recordFailure()` above.

**Where failures land once retries are exhausted: a Postgres table, not a second Kafka topic.** A dedicated dead-letter Kafka topic earns its complexity when other services need to independently consume or replay failures, or failures must survive even if this service's own database is down. Neither applies here - nothing else in the platform is designed to read IoT failures, and a queryable table is simpler to operate for a single-owned module than standing up a second Kafka topic and its own producer just to write to it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE iot_data.ingestion_failures (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    kafka_topic     TEXT NOT NULL,
    kafka_partition INT NOT NULL,
    kafka_offset    BIGINT NOT NULL,
    raw_payload     BYTEA NOT NULL,
    failure_stage   TEXT NOT NULL,    -- 'decode' | 'redis_write' | 'timescale_write'
    error_reason    TEXT NOT NULL,
    attempt_count   INT NOT NULL,     -- passed explicitly by the caller, not a silent default (see above)
    failed_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_ingestion_failures_failed_at ON iot_data.ingestion_failures (failed_at DESC);
```

No retention policy on this table - it's diagnostic, not telemetry. If it grows large quickly, that's a symptom worth investigating, not something to quietly auto-delete.

**Critical rule:** the Kafka offset commits *after* the failure is recorded, never left uncommitted - an uncommitted poison message blocks every message behind it in that partition forever.

---

## 4. Redis - hot storage design

Hot storage answers one question fast: **"what is this house doing right now?"** No history, just the latest state, overwritten every time a new reading arrives.

Key structure, with explicit Redis data types:

| Key pattern | Redis type | Value / fields | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `meter:{grid_id}:{house_id}:latest` | **STRING** (JSON-serialized) | Full JSON blob of the most recent meter reading | Fast lookup of current solar/consumption/net_kw/storage state per house. Written wholesale every tick via `SET`, read via `GET` - a STRING is the right fit since the whole reading always replaces the previous one atomically, never partially updated. |
| `house:{house_id}:status` | **HASH** | `status` (online/offline), `last_heartbeat_at` | Two related fields updated together on every heartbeat via `HSET`, read via `HGETALL`. A HASH (not a STRING) is used here since it's a small structured record where individual fields make sense to reference directly. |
| `grid:{grid_id}:houses` | **SET** | Members = house IDs | Membership set for "which houses exist in this grid," via `SADD`/`SREM`/`SMEMBERS`. `SADD` is naturally idempotent, so it's safe to call on every heartbeat without checking existence first. |

**TTL behavior:** `house:{house_id}:status` gets a **10-minute TTL** (confirmed by team member) via `EXPIRE`, refreshed on every heartbeat - if no heartbeat arrives within that window, the key expires and a consumer can infer the house has gone quiet. `meter:{grid_id}:{house_id}:latest` has no TTL (always overwritten). `grid:{grid_id}:houses` also has no TTL - grid membership shouldn't silently expire just because a house happened to go quiet for a while.

---

## 5. Heartbeat processing - device discovery flow

This section spells out the exact flow, since a heartbeat can represent either a completely new device being seen for the first time, or a known device simply checking in again - both cases need to be handled cleanly, in both storage tiers, without creating duplicates.

When a `Heartbeat` message is consumed from Kafka, this service performs the following, **in order**:

**Step 0 - Warm storage, defensive grid auto-create (added during final review - see section 6.4 for full reasoning):**
```sql
INSERT INTO iot_data.grids (grid_id, lat, lon)
VALUES ($1, NULL, NULL)
ON CONFLICT (grid_id) DO NOTHING;
```
This exists purely as a safety net. Grids are normally seeded in advance via migration (section 6.4) with real coordinates - this statement only ever fires if a heartbeat arrives for a `grid_id` that was never seeded, preventing the next step's foreign key from failing outright. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` guarantees this never overwrites a properly-seeded grid's real coordinates with nulls.

**Step 1 - Warm storage, house registry:**
```sql
INSERT INTO iot_data.houses (house_id, grid_id, device_class, rated_solar_kw, first_seen_at, last_heartbeat_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, now(), now())
ON CONFLICT (house_id) DO UPDATE SET
    last_heartbeat_at = now();
    -- device_class / rated_solar_kw intentionally NOT overwritten on conflict -
    -- these are set once at first discovery; if they need to change later,
    -- that should be a deliberate decision, not a silent overwrite on every heartbeat.
```
This single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` handles both cases in one statement: if `house_id` has never been seen before, it's inserted as a brand-new row. If it already exists, only `last_heartbeat_at` is refreshed.

**Step 2 - Warm storage, flexible asset registry (for each asset in the heartbeat's `flexible_assets` array):**
```sql
INSERT INTO iot_data.flexible_assets (asset_id, house_id, asset_type, capacity_kwh, max_charge_kw, max_discharge_kw, v2g_capable, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, now(), now())
ON CONFLICT (asset_id) DO UPDATE SET
    capacity_kwh = EXCLUDED.capacity_kwh,
    max_charge_kw = EXCLUDED.max_charge_kw,
    max_discharge_kw = EXCLUDED.max_discharge_kw,
    v2g_capable = EXCLUDED.v2g_capable,
    updated_at = now();
```
Unlike the house record, asset specs **are** refreshed on every heartbeat - reasonable, since hardware specs being corrected/updated is plausible and there's no strong reason to lock them the way `device_class` is treated above.

**Step 3 - Hot storage (Redis):**
```
HSET house:{house_id}:status status "online" last_heartbeat_at "<now>"
EXPIRE house:{house_id}:status 600
SADD grid:{grid_id}:houses {house_id}
```
Both operations are safe to run unconditionally on every heartbeat, new device or not.

**What does NOT get written to Redis on a heartbeat:** asset specs (capacity, max charge/discharge kw) are only stored in TimescaleDB's registry tables, not duplicated into Redis. Hot storage is for *live, frequently-changing state* - static hardware specs that change rarely are already fast to look up in Postgres via primary key.

---

## 6. TimescaleDB - warm storage design

TimescaleDB is Postgres with a time-series extension (hypertables) layered on top. **Confirmed from `gridx-infra`'s bootstrap SQL:** this service gets exactly one schema, `iot_data`, provisioned inside the `gridx-timescaledb` container (host port 5433, internal 5432). Everything this service owns lives inside `iot_data`.

Within that single schema, the plan splits data into two categories: **plain tables (ER-style)** for things that rarely change (grids, houses, flexible assets), and **hypertables (time-series)** for the actual telemetry stream.

**Credentials:** the schema/user bootstrap lives in `gridx-infra/init-scripts/timescaledb/01-init-timescaledb.sql`. It creates a dedicated `IOT_SERVICE_USER`, owning the `iot_data` schema exclusively, public access revoked platform-wide.

**Important operational note:** these init scripts run only **once**, the first time the container starts against an empty data volume. The application tables below should not be added by editing this bootstrap script - this service needs its own separate, versioned migration mechanism (section 6.3).

**Confirmed by team member: heartbeats are not stored as time-series history.** A heartbeat only ever updates `last_heartbeat_at` on the relevant row in `iot_data.houses` - there is no `heartbeats` hypertable.

**ER diagram:** the team member will produce this manually from the table definitions below.

### 6.1 Plain Postgres tables (schema: `iot_data`)

```sql
-- Registry of grids. lat/lon are nullable - see section 6.4 for why: a grid
-- row can come into existence either via a curated seed migration (with real
-- coordinates) or via defensive auto-create from an unseeded heartbeat
-- (section 5, Step 0), which has no coordinates to provide yet.
CREATE TABLE iot_data.grids (
    grid_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    lat           DOUBLE PRECISION,
    lon           DOUBLE PRECISION,
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Registry of houses, updated occasionally (e.g. when a heartbeat reports new info).
-- last_heartbeat_at is updated in place on every heartbeat. There is deliberately no
-- separate "status" column here - online/offline is computed on read from
-- last_heartbeat_at (e.g. status = now() - last_heartbeat_at < interval '10 minutes'),
-- so there is exactly one source of truth for liveness, not a Postgres column that
-- could drift out of sync with the Redis TTL key from section 4.
CREATE TABLE iot_data.houses (
    house_id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    grid_id             TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES iot_data.grids(grid_id),
    device_class        TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (device_class IN ('consumer','residential_prosumer','commercial')),
    rated_solar_kw      DOUBLE PRECISION,
    first_seen_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    last_heartbeat_at   TIMESTAMPTZ
);
CREATE INDEX idx_houses_grid_id ON iot_data.houses(grid_id);

-- Registry of flexible assets (batteries/EVs) attached to a house
CREATE TABLE iot_data.flexible_assets (
    asset_id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    house_id          TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES iot_data.houses(house_id),
    asset_type        TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (asset_type IN ('bess','ev')),
    capacity_kwh      DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    max_charge_kw     DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    max_discharge_kw  DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    v2g_capable       BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_flexible_assets_house_id ON iot_data.flexible_assets(house_id);
```

These get populated/updated from **heartbeat** messages (section 5), since a heartbeat is exactly what tells us a house or asset exists and what it's capable of.

### 6.2 Hypertables (analytical / time-series)

```sql
-- One row per meter reading, per house, per tick
CREATE TABLE iot_data.meter_readings (
    time                     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    house_id                 TEXT NOT NULL,
    grid_id                  TEXT NOT NULL,
    seq                      BIGINT NOT NULL,
    solar_kw                 DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    consumption_kw           DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    net_kw                   DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
    weather_irradiance_wm2   DOUBLE PRECISION,
    cloud_cover_pct          DOUBLE PRECISION,
    PRIMARY KEY (house_id, time, seq)
);

-- Default 7-day chunks don't fit a 5-second tick rate well - explicit 1-day
-- chunks keep individual chunks a manageable size at this ingestion volume.
SELECT create_hypertable('iot_data.meter_readings', 'time', chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');
CREATE INDEX idx_meter_readings_grid_time ON iot_data.meter_readings (grid_id, time DESC);

-- One row per storage asset, per meter reading (normalized out of the meter
-- reading's storage_assets array - a house can have more than one asset).
CREATE TABLE iot_data.storage_asset_readings (
    time         TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,

```

**Confirmed by team member: retention window is 6 months.**

```sql
SELECT add_retention_policy('iot_data.meter_readings', INTERVAL '6 months');
SELECT add_retention_policy('iot_data.storage_asset_readings', INTERVAL '6 months');
```

Since cold storage isn't set up yet, this permanently deletes data older than 6 months rather than archiving it - confirmed acceptable for now.

**Recommended, not yet confirmed by the team:** a compression policy for chunks past their "hot query" window:

```sql
ALTER TABLE iot_data.meter_readings SET (
    timescaledb.compress,
    timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'house_id'
);
SELECT add_compression_policy('iot_data.meter_readings', INTERVAL '7 days');

ALTER TABLE iot_data.storage_asset_readings SET (
    timescaledb.compress,
    timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'asset_id'
);
SELECT add_compression_policy('iot_data.storage_asset_readings', INTERVAL '7 days');
```

### 6.3 Migration tooling

**Recommendation: [`pressly/goose`](https://github.com/pressly/goose).** Compared against `golang-migrate` on "best and simple": single-package setup vs. separate driver/source imports, native Go-migration support alongside plain SQL (useful for data seeds like section 6.4), native `embed.FS` support so migrations ship inside the compiled binary. Since this service only ever talks to one database engine, `golang-migrate`'s broader multi-database driver support isn't a relevant advantage here.

```bash
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```
Migration files live under `internal/timescale/migrations/`, embedded via `embed.FS`, applied via `goose.Up()` programmatically on startup before the Kafka consumer starts.

### 6.4 Grid provisioning - seed data and defensive fallback

**The gap this closes:** neither `MeterReading` nor `Heartbeat` ever carries a grid's lat/lon - it's simulator-internal config (`grids.yaml`), never published over MQTT. A smart meter reports what it measures, not where its zone's coordinates are; location is provisioning data, decided once, not telemetry.

**Part 1 - seed known grids via migration**, sourced directly from the simulator's actual `config/grids.yaml`:

> ⚠️ **Assumption flagged explicitly:** the lat/lon values below are recalled from earlier in this planning process, not freshly re-checked against the current `config/grids.yaml`. **Pull the real, current values from that file before running this migration** - do not trust the numbers below as-is.

```sql
-- 20260810_seed_known_grids.sql
INSERT INTO iot_data.grids (grid_id, lat, lon) VALUES
    ('grid01', 6.9271, 79.8612),
    ('grid02', 9.6615, 80.0255),
    ('grid03', 7.8731, 80.6550)
ON CONFLICT (grid_id) DO NOTHING;
```
If a new grid is added to the simulator's config later, that's a *new* migration appending a row - never an edit to this one, same discipline as the schema migrations themselves.

**Part 2 - defend against an unseeded grid_id showing up anyway.** Two repos, two people, a config drifting out of sync is a realistic failure mode. `houses.grid_id REFERENCES grids.grid_id` means a heartbeat for a grid nobody seeded would otherwise fail the whole house upsert with a foreign key violation. Section 5's Step 0 handles this - a defensive `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with `NULL` coordinates, run immediately before the house upsert. This is why `grids.lat`/`grids.lon` are nullable in section 6.1 - there are legitimately two ways a grid row is created (curated seed with known coordinates, or auto-discovered via heartbeat with none yet), and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` guarantees the defensive path never clobbers a properly-seeded row.

**Side benefit:** a grid row sitting with `lat IS NULL` becomes a visible, queryable "someone forgot to provision this" signal instead of a crash:
```sql
SELECT grid_id FROM iot_data.grids WHERE lat IS NULL;
```

## 7. Dispatch Service (planned - not implemented in this phase)

**This section reflects the team's current best understanding, explicitly flagged by the team member as "not properly planned" yet - treat everything below as a rough direction, not a locked design.**

- **The Matching Engine does not deal with individual assets at all** - it has no visibility into specific batteries/EVs, so it is *not* the thing that directly triggers Dispatch.
- **The current rough idea:** an **Order Service** (not yet part of this plan's scope) makes a **gRPC call** to the Dispatch Service to request a change - e.g. "reduce this house's battery stored energy" - based on **user preferences** rather than a raw trade signal.
- **Dispatch Service's job**, once triggered: translate that request into an actuation command and publish it to the IoT Simulator's `gridx/actuation` MQTT topic, targeting the correct `house_id` and `asset_id`.

The IoT Simulator already has the receiving end of this built and tested - this service is the missing sender.

**Not being built this phase.**

---

## 8. gRPC interfaces (planned - not implemented in this phase)

**8.1 Ingestion query interface** - other services will need to *read* hot/warm data:
- `GetLatestReading(house_id)` - hits Redis
- `GetHistoricalReadings(house_id, start_time, end_time)` - hits TimescaleDB
- `GetGridSummary(grid_id)` - aggregate view across a grid's houses

**8.2 Dispatch command interface** - per section 7, the Order Service would make a gRPC call *to* the Dispatch Service to *trigger* an actuation - a command/write interface, belonging to Dispatch rather than Ingestion.

**Neither is being built this phase.** Both should reuse the same `go-sdk`-sourced message types from section 3.2 once the proto contracts are merged, rather than defining a second, parallel set of types.

---

## 9. Tech stack

- **Language:** Go
- **Kafka client:** [`franz-go`](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go) (`github.com/twmb/franz-go`). Pure Go, no cgo dependency (unlike `confluent-kafka-go`, which wraps `librdkafka` and drags a C toolchain into the Docker build). Chosen over `segmentio/kafka-go` for more active maintenance and a more complete feature set. **Honesty note:** the specific claim that `kafka-go` lacks cross-partition produce batching (a throughput ceiling `franz-go` doesn't share) came from research earlier in this planning process, not independently re-verified in this pass - worth a quick confirm against each library's current docs before treating it as fully settled, since this kind of detail can shift between library versions. The broader "pure Go, more actively maintained" reasoning is on firmer ground and less likely to have changed. The trade-off either way is a slightly steeper initial learning curve, closer to the raw Kafka protocol than `kafka-go`'s thinner abstraction - a one-time cost with solid documentation available.
- **Message types:** `go-sdk` (org repo) - proto-generated Go types, installed as a Go module dependency. A new `iot/v1` package needs authoring first - see section 3.2.
- **Retry/backoff:** [`cenkalti/backoff/v5`](https://github.com/cenkalti/backoff) - see section 3.3 for the transient-vs-permanent failure handling pattern.
- **Redis client:** `go-redis`, connecting to `gridx-redis:6379`.
- **TimescaleDB/Postgres client:** `pgx`, connecting to `gridx-timescaledb` (host port 5433), using `IOT_SERVICE_USER`/`IOT_SERVICE_PASSWORD`, scoped to `iot_data` only.
- **Migrations:** `pressly/goose` - see section 6.3.
- **Testing:** `testify` (assertions) for unit and mocked-dependency tests; `testcontainers-go` (`modules/kafka`, `modules/postgres`, `modules/redis`) for integration tests - see section 10.
- **Logging:** stdlib `log/slog` - sufficient for a service this size, no reason to pull in a third-party logger.
- **gRPC (future):** protobuf-defined service, not implemented yet - see section 8.
- **Infrastructure:** runs as a new container alongside the existing `gridx-infra` services - Kafka, Redis, and TimescaleDB are already bootstrapped there.

---

## 10. Testing strategy

Four tiers, mirroring the IoT Simulator's own testing discipline (161 tests, CI-enforced) adapted for a service whose real dependencies are Kafka/Redis/Postgres rather than pure computation.

**Tier 1 - Unit tests.** No containers, no network, milliseconds each. Table-driven, using `testify/require`. Covers: JSON/proto→domain mapping for every `device_class`/`asset_type` value plus at least one invalid one, the missing-`storage_assets` case, the transient-vs-permanent error classifier from section 3.3.

**Tier 2 - Mocked-dependency tests.** Still no containers - these test *control flow*, not whether Redis/Postgres itself behaves correctly. Define narrow interfaces (`HotStore`, `WarmStore`) that real clients implement in production and fakes implement in tests. Answers questions like: if the Redis write fails, does TimescaleDB still get attempted? Does a permanent decode error skip straight to `ingestion_failures` without touching either store? Does the offset stay uncommitted until both writes succeed?

**Tier 3 - Integration tests via `testcontainers-go`.** Real, ephemeral containers spun up per test run: `testcontainers-go/modules/kafka` (KRaft-mode), `testcontainers-go/modules/postgres` (works against a `timescale/timescaledb` image too, since it's still Postgres underneath), `testcontainers-go/modules/redis`. Answers: do goose migrations apply clean on a fresh schema? Is the `meter_readings` upsert genuinely idempotent (write the same `house_id`/`time`/`seq` twice, assert exactly one row)? Does a second heartbeat for a known house update only `last_heartbeat_at`, not `device_class`? Does the grid auto-create path from section 6.4 actually work?

**Tier 4 - Manual, one-time, end-to-end.** Real simulator, real Kafka Connect, real this-service, actually pointed at each other. This is where section 13's still-open live-verification item gets closed for good - no amount of testcontainers substitutes for checking the actual seam between this service and the real upstream pipeline.

**CI note for whoever sets up the pipeline (team member, per section 12):** Tier 3 needs Docker available on the runner. GitHub's default `ubuntu-latest` runners have it preinstalled, so this is usually a non-issue, but worth confirming before debugging a mysteriously failing pipeline.

---

## 11. Repository structure (proposed)

**Note on `internal/health/` below:** the `/healthz` endpoint was never explicitly requested by the team member - it's included because every other service in `gridx-infra`'s `docker-compose.yml` already has a healthcheck, and matching that established convention seemed like a reasonable default. Flagging this plainly rather than presenting it as if it were a stated requirement - drop it if it's not wanted.

## 12. Things we still need to decide as a team

**Resolved from `gridx-infra`'s bootstrap scripts, docker-compose, and connector config (no longer open):**
- ~~Kafka container/port~~ - confirmed `gridx-kafka:9092` (external), `kafka:29092` (internal)
- ~~TimescaleDB container/port~~ - confirmed `gridx-timescaledb`, host port 5433
- ~~Schema ownership~~ - confirmed `iot_data`, owned by `IOT_SERVICE_USER`
- ~~Which DB instance hosts what~~ - confirmed `gridx-postgres` is Auth/Orders/Billing/Notifications only; all IoT data lives in `iot_data` on `gridx-timescaledb`
- ~~Bridge implementation~~ - confirmed: Kafka Connect running Confluent's `MqttSourceConnector`
- ~~Kafka Connect topic mismatch~~ - **fixed**, see section 2
- ~~Exact Kafka topic names~~ - confirmed: `iot.meter-readings` and `iot.heartbeats`

**Resolved by team member (no longer open):**
- ~~Meter readings vs heartbeats sharing one Kafka topic~~ - confirmed split into two, implemented (section 2)
- ~~`iot_data` table design approach~~ - confirmed: hypertables + plain tables split
- ~~Heartbeat storage~~ - confirmed: no historical hypertable, only `last_heartbeat_at` updates
- ~~Redis TTL for `house:{house_id}:status`~~ - confirmed: 10 minutes
- ~~Redis key types~~ - confirmed and documented in section 4
- ~~Heartbeat device-discovery flow~~ - confirmed and documented in section 5
- ~~Hypertable retention~~ - confirmed: 6 months
- ~~Migration tooling~~ - confirmed: `goose` (section 6.3)
- ~~ER diagram~~ - to be produced manually by team member from section 6's table definitions
- ~~Dispatch Service trigger mechanism~~ - rough direction confirmed, flagged "not properly planned," treat as tentative

**Resolved during final pre-development review (this pass):**
- ~~Grid lat/lon has no data source~~ - resolved via seed migration + defensive auto-create fallback (section 6.4)
- ~~Dead-letter / poison-message strategy~~ - resolved: two-tier retry via `cenkalti/backoff/v5` + `ingestion_failures` table (section 3.3)
- ~~Testing strategy~~ - resolved: four-tier plan (section 10)
- ~~Kafka client library~~ - resolved: `franz-go` (section 9)
- ~~Consumer group structure~~ - resolved: single group, both topics, topic-based dispatch (section 3)
- ~~Partitioning~~ - likely resolved: Confluent's connector docs confirm topic-as-key default behavior, satisfying the ordering requirement without extra config. Still worth a live confirm once traffic flows (see below).

**Still open:**
- 🔴 **The protobuf/JSON wire format question - reopened, not resolved.** Team member states Kafka data arrives as binary; direct evidence (connector's `ByteArrayConverter`, simulator's confirmed `JSON.stringify()`) suggests otherwise unless an unreviewed upstream mechanism performs the conversion. Resolves with one command: `kcat -b localhost:9092 -t iot.meter-readings -C -c 1` (see section 3.1 for the corrected hostname and full reasoning). Worth raising this specific question back to the team member - not just deciding privately - since it hinges on infrastructure neither of us has fully traced yet.
- **Whether the new connector configs are actually registered with Kafka Connect and verified against live simulator traffic** - files exist and topic patterns match on paper, but end-to-end verification is still pending (section 13).
- **Whether the topic-as-key partitioning assumption actually holds live** - plausible per documentation, worth confirming once traffic is flowing.
- **Compression policy** - proposed in section 6.2 but not yet confirmed by the team, unlike retention.
- The Order Service / Dispatch Service gRPC interaction (section 7, 8.2) - explicitly not properly planned yet.
- **CI/CD pipeline and final repo structure** - to be set up by the team member once this plan is confirmed.

---

## 13. Note on the Kafka Connect connector setup

**Status: topic pattern fixed (section 2), two items remain before this is fully closed out.**

- ~~File(s) to change~~ - done: replaced by `mqtt-connector-meter.json` and `mqtt-connector-heartbeat.json`.
- ~~Registration script~~ - confirmed: `scripts/register-connectors.sh` correctly references both new files and POSTs each to the Kafka Connect REST API. Must be run manually after `docker compose up -d` - it does not run automatically.
- **Whether the connector configs themselves need to change for protobuf** - depends entirely on section 3.1's still-open wire-format question. If the wire format is confirmed as JSON (matching current direct evidence), no further connector change is needed - the JSON→protobuf-struct decode happens inside this service (section 3.1's isolated decode function). If it's confirmed as genuinely binary, something upstream of this service - not yet identified - must be performing that conversion, and that's a question for whoever owns the connector/bridge setup, not something this service can resolve on its own.
- **Not yet confirmed:** live, end-to-end verification - running the IoT Simulator, confirming both connectors show as running via Kafka Connect's REST API or `scripts/health-check.sh`, and confirming real messages land in `iot.meter-readings`/`iot.heartbeats` (e.g. via the `kcat` command in section 3.1, which resolves this and the wire-format question in the same step).
